# Negative_Search_Algo_Genetic_Algo
A Negative Search Algorithm where detectors are found using Genetic Algorithm

This is a python code in which the detectors are found using Genetic Algorithm of Negative Search Algorithm.It is according to the [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/redirect.jsp?arnumber=/4016751/4016752/04016775.pdf) Genetic Algorithms-based Detector Generation in Negative Selection Algorithm

The instruction file is in the format 
```
Radius_for_the_Self-data   No_of_detectors   No_of_samples_for_GA
No_of_epochs_for_GA
```
